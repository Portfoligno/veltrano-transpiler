// Expected error: Ambiguous method call
// This example should FAIL type checking with an ambiguous method call error

// Import the same method (new) from Vec twice with same alias
// This creates a true ambiguity since both imports are identical
import Vec.new as create
import Vec.new as create

fun main() {
    // This should fail because we have two identical imports with same alias
    val container = create()
    
    println("{:?}", container)
}
